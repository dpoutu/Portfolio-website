  <h2>Cybersecurity Awareness</h2>

  <p>Cyber security plays a big part in keeping people safe on the internet. No one wants to be another statistic in identity fraud. It's surprisingly easy to fall into those situations — whether through weak passwords, outdated security measures, or simple phishing scams. That’s why it’s important to stay vigilant. This site is dedicated to spreading awareness about online threats and helping you safeguard your digital identity. Tips to avoid scams and security risks: here are some practical ways to protect yourself from cyber threats and minimize security risks.</p>

  <p>Understanding Cybersecurity: why it matters. The internet is a powerful tool, but with every click, login, and transaction there’s a risk. Cybercriminals constantly seek ways to exploit weak passwords, outdated security measures, and unsuspecting users. Falling victim to scams or data breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and compromised personal information. The best defense is awareness. Knowing the risks and understanding how to protect yourself can make all the difference.</p>

  <div class="tips">
    <p>Phishing — Fraudsters trick users into providing sensitive data through fake emails and websites.</p>
    <p>Tip: Never click on suspicious links. Verify sources before entering personal information.</p>

    <p>Weak passwords — Simple or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into accounts.</p>
    <p>Tip: Use long, complex passphrases with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</p>

    <p>Unsecured websites — Sites without encryption (HTTP instead of HTTPS) can expose your data.</p>
    <p>Tip: Always check the URL for HTTPS before entering sensitive information.</p>

    <p>Public Wi-Fi risks — Open networks are easy targets for hackers intercepting data.</p>
    <p>Tip: Avoid using public Wi-Fi for transactions. Use a VPN for secure browsing.</p>

    <p>Social engineering attacks — Cybercriminals manipulate people into sharing confidential details.</p>
    <p>Tip: Be cautious of unexpected phone calls, messages, or emails requesting personal data.</p>

  <h3>Building a secure digital presence</h3>
  <p>Keeping your online identity safe doesn’t require advanced tech skills — it simply starts with smart digital habits. From enabling two-factor authentication to regularly updating software, every step you take makes you less of a target. Stay informed, stay protected. Because cybersecurity isn’t just for experts — it’s for everyone.</p>
