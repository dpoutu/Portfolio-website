          Hi! I'm Darcy Poutu, a passionate, detail-driven problem solver with
          <br />
          a love for technology and continuous learning. My journey into <br />
          computing began with curiosity and has evolved into a deep commitment
          <br />
          to creating meaningful and impactful digital projects. My strong
          <br />
          attention to detail, quick understanding, and growing technical <br />
          knowledge allow me to take on challenges that others hesitate to
          <br />
          touch. Challenge excites me so much that my personal motto has become
          <br />
          “challenge accepted.” I believe that hard work, dedication, and the
          <br />
          right mindset can turn any goal into reality. What started as an
          <br />
          interest has grown into a true obsession, and I’m determined to do
          <br />
          whatever it takes to get the job done and share my work with the
          <br />
          world. Beyond work and study, I am curious, open-minded, and always
          <br />
          eager to learn new skills. I enjoy taking on challenges, exploring new
          <br />
          technologies, and pushing myself to grow both personally and <br />
          professionally. This combination of focus, creativity, and resilience
          <br />
          allows me to approach problems thoughtfully while taking action <br />
          confidently, making me adaptable and dependable in any situation.

            Here you'll find my background story, how I got started, and what motivates me in my tech journey.
          </p>
        <p>
          I started my career as a welder for a few years, which is why my
          <br />
          background reflects welding. However, it was not my true passion. I’ve
          <br />
          always been fascinated by the complexities of computers, especially
          <br />
          coding, and the incredible things you can create by giving a few
          <br />
          rulesets to a computer and watching it execute them. What began as a
          <br />
          hobby quickly grew into a passion, and eventually became an obsession.
          <br />
          This led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computing Systems, where I am
          <br />
          deepening my understanding of programming, networking, and system
          <br />
          design. My education has taught me the value of both precision and
          <br />
          creativity in solving technical challenges efficiently and <br />
          effectively.

</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is to become a master full-stack developer, explore AI and
          <br />
          machine learning, and work on projects that solve real-world problems
          <br />
          at scale. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that
          <br />
          make a meaningful difference. I strive to deepen my skills in both
          <br />
          front-end and back-end development, with the long-term ambition of
          <br />
          running my own company where I can lead projects, build <br />
          technology-driven solutions, and deliver value on a larger scale. I am
          <br />
          motivated by challenges and enjoy pushing the boundaries of my <br />
          abilities, constantly learning new technologies and approaches. My
          <br />
          focus is on turning ideas into actionable projects, improving <br />
          efficiency, and creating tools that have practical impact.

</h2>
        <p>
          I value creativity, perseverance, and teamwork, and I thrive when
          <br />
          brainstorming new ideas, experimenting with different approaches, and
          <br />
          collaborating with others to bring concepts to life. I perform well
          <br />
          under pressure and can think on my feet, coming up with solutions on
          <br />
          the spot. I’m not afraid to pitch ideas, even if they might not always
          <br />
          work in my favor, because I believe every attempt is an opportunity to
          <br />
          learn and improve. At the same time, I am naturally shy and a bit
          <br />
          introverted, which allows me to focus deeply, especially with music,
          <br />
          which helps my mind hyper-focus and dive into complex problems. While
          <br />
          I work best with periods of focused concentration, I am also <br />
          comfortable in team environments, communicating effectively when it’s
          <br />
          needed to achieve shared goals. I have a strong sense of discipline;
          <br />
          being late unsettles me, so I strive to manage my time carefully and
          <br />
          respect deadlines. Overall, my personality blends thoughtful <br />
          introspection with proactive engagement, making me adaptable, <br />
          reliable, and driven in both individual and collaborative projects.

          Technology never stops evolving and neither should we. Every new
          project and experience helps me grow as a developer and as a person,
          ready to face challenges and keep learning.
